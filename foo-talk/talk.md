# Talk

* Place your talk here
* Remember, no more than 20 slides
* And exactly 15 seconds per slide
* That gives you exactly 5 minutes for your talk!

# Slide 2

```python
def f():
  return 42
```

* Yet another slide
* It talks about the `f` function
* Yay!

# Slide 3

* Just 17 more slides to go
* Hope no one is falling asleep
